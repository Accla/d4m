<p>TODO provide overview of Mutations, timestamps, security, etc.
<p>TODO provide pointers into Java doc

<h3>Batch Operations</h3>
The cloudbase client API provides batch readers and writers.  Use this capability when you need to do lots of updates or lookups.  
This functionality is provided by the BatchWriter and BatchReader classes.  Examples that utilize this capability are in the <a href=../examples/client/>client example directory</a>.  

<p>TaBatchWriter is capable of pushing a lot of data into cloudbase, especially when you run
multiple instances on different machines.  An easy way to run multiple instances is to use a map
only Map Reduce that outputs using CBOutputFormat.  However, for very large volumes of data <a href=bulkIngest.html>Bulk Ingest</a> is an
alternative.  The bulk ingest documentation details some of the pros and cons of using it vs CBOutputFormat (CBOutputFormat uses BatchWriter).
