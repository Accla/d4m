Cloudbase keeps track of information about itself in a special
table called !METADATA. As the metadata table grows on a cluster, 
performance may degrade.  To deal with this, you can force the 
metadata table to split into multiple tablets. Do this when you 
already have a large existing metadata table.  This will make 
cloudbase system run faster and start faster.  This is a temporary
measure.  Future versions of cloudbase will  not require this
cumbersome process.  The process only needs to be applied on a
large cluster.

Use the following steps to split the metadata table.

* Bring cloudbase down
* Modify the following cloudbase !METADATA specific settings using the shell (save original settings)
   * cloudbase.tablet.split.threshold = 500000 (see note below)
* Start one tablet server
* Start master in safe mode (cloudbase.sh master safeMode)
* Let metdata table split (splits happen ever 30 sec, so let it go a few
rounds.)
* Bring cloudbase down
* Revert to original cloudbase stettings
* Start cloudbase

Maybe set cloudbase.tablet.split.threshold lower if you want
more splits (7M metadata table split into 16 tablets, check size of
metadata table map files in HDFS, do this check after stopping cloudbase)

Watch tablet server logs to know when splitting and major compacting is
finished.
