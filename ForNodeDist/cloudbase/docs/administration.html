<p>TODO provide overview of starting and stopping cloudbase

<h3>Configuration</h3>
Cloudbase configuration information is stored in a xml file and zoo keeper.  System wide
configuration information is stored in cloudbase-site.xml.  Inorder for cloudbase to
find this file its directory must be on the classpath.  Cloudbase will log a warning if it can not find 
it.  The cloudbase scripts try to put the config directory on the classpath.  

<p>Starting with version 1.0 per table configuration was introduced.  This
information is stored in zoo keeper.  This information can be manipulated using the config command in
the cloudbase shell.  The great thing about storing these config properties in zoo keeper is that all
tablet servers are notified of configuration changes.  This makes it possible to change
major compaction settings for a table while cloudbase is running.

<p>Per table configuration settings override system settings.
