 * Cloudbase uses Constraint objects to determine if 
 * mutations will be applied to a table.  
 * 
 * This interface expects implementers to return violation
 * codes.  The reason codes are returned instead of arbitrary
 * strings it to encourage conciseness.  Conciseness is needed
 * because violations are aggregated.  If a user sends a batch
 * of 10,000 mutations to cloudbase, only aggregated counts
 * about which violations occurred are returned.
 * 
 * If the Constraint implementer was allowed to return arbitrary
 * violation strings like the following :
 * 
 *   Value "abc" is not a number
 *   Value "vbg" is not a number
 *   
 * Then this would not aggregate very well, because the same 
 * violation is represented with two different strings.
