#When cloudbase is stuck, it is often caused by a problem on one
#server.  This script helps you find an offending tablet server
#or datanode.  If you suspect it is a cloudbase problem, run this
#script against all of the machines ingesting data into cloudbase.
#The script will attempt to find many ingesting machines that have
#blocked outgoing data for a common tablet servers.  If you 
#suspect there is a hadoop problem, run this script for all of the
#tablet servers and see if there is a problematic data node.
