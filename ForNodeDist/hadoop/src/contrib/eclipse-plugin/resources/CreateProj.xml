		<description>
			This tutorial guides you through the creation of a simple
			MapReduce project with three MapReduce classes: a Mapper, a
			Reducer, and a Driver.

			Select <b>Window->Open Perspective->MapReduce</b> in the menubar at
			the top of the workbench. This step changes the perspective
			to set up the Eclipse workbench for MapReduce development.

			The first thing you will need is a MapReduce Project. If you
			already have a MapReduce project in your workspace that you
			would like to use, you may skip this step by clicking the
			"Click to Skip" button. If not, select <b>File->New->Project</b>
			and choose MapReduce Project in the list. Complete the
			subsequent pages as required.

		<action pluginId="org.eclipse.jdt.ui"
			class="org.eclipse.jdt.ui.actions.OpenNewPackageWizardAction" />
		<description>
			You should now have a MapReduce project in your workspace.
			The next thing to do is creating a package. Use the Eclipse
			tools by selecting <b>File -> New ->Package</b> action. Specify the
			source folder (the project containing the package). Then,
			give the package a name, such as "mapreduce.test", and click
			the "Finish" button. If you already have a project with a
			package you might as well skip this step.

		<description>
			Now you should be set up for creating your MapReduce
			application.  The MapReduce application consists of three
			classes: a Mapper class, a Reducer class and a Driver class.
			In this step you will create the three classes.  Use the
			class wizard by selecting <b>File -> New -> Class</b>.  
			Repeat this for	every class.
