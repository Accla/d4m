WHAT CHUKWA IS

Chukwa is a data collection system being built to monitor and analyze large
distributed systems. Chukwa is built on top of Hadoop, an open source 
Map-Reduce and distributed filesystem implementation, and inherits Hadoop's
scalability and robustness. Chukwa also includes a flexible and powerful
toolkit for displaying monitoring and analysis results, in order to make the
best use of this collected data.

Chukwa is currently in early stages of implementation. It runs, but documentation
is still sketchy, and many rough edges remain.

Chukwa is being developed as an open source project by Yahoo!, inc.
The Chukwa development team consists of: Jerome Boulon, Andy Konwinski, Runping Qi,
Ari Rabkin, Eric Yang, and Mac Yang.
  
Questions should be addressed to Mac Yang: macyang@yahoo-inc.com


RUNNING CHUKWA -- LOCAL QUICKSTART


The Chukwa monitoring system has a number of components.   
This section gives guidance on starting each of them on your local machine. 

You should start the collector first, then the agent, and finally any adaptors.

*  Compiling and installing Chukwa

   - If Chukwa is in the hadoop contrib directory, you should be able to just
     say ``ant'' in the project root directory.
   
   - Otherwise, 

*  Configuring and starting the Collector

   - Copy conf/chukwa-collector-conf.xml.template to conf/chukwa-collector-conf.xml
      
   - Edit the writer.hdfs.filesystem property to point to a real filesystem.
   
   - If you are running hadoop, this should be the path to the namenode.
   
   - If you are not running hadoop, you can just juse a local path, of the form
    file:///tmp/chukwa.
    
   - Copy conf/chukwa-env.sh-template to conf/chukwa-env.sh.  Set JAVA_HOME in file.
    
   - In the chukwa root directory, say ``bash bin/jettyCollector.sh''

*  Configuring and starting the Local Agent
 
  - Copy conf/chukwa-agent-conf.xml.template to conf/chukwa-agent-conf.xml
  
  - Copy conf/collectors.template to conf/collectors

  - In the chukwa root directory, say ``bash bin/agent.sh''

*  Starting Adaptors
  The local agent speaks a simple text-based protocol, by default over port 9093.
Suppose you want Chukwa to start tailing a file /path/to/file of type MyFileType 
on localhost:

  - Telnet to localhost 9093
  
  - Type [without quotation marks] "ADD CharFileTailerUTF8 MyFileType /path/to/file 0"

  - Chukwa internal Namenode's type is NameNodeType so for namenode log
  Type [without quotation marks] "ADD CharFileTailerUTF8 NameNodeType /path/to/nameNodeFie 0"
  
  - Type "list" -- you should see the adaptor you just started, listed as running. 
  
  - Type  "close" to break the connection.
  
  If you don't have telnet, you can get the same effect with netcat (``nc''). 
    
*  Configuring and starting the demux job

  - Edit bin/chukwa-config.sh to match your system configuration
  
  - In the chukwa root directory, say ``bash bin/processSinkFiles.sh'' 
  
*  Configuring and starting HICC

  - Download Apache Tomcat from http://tomcat.apache.org/download-60.cgi
  
  - Configure CHUKWA_HOME environment variable pointing to the Chukwa home directory.

  - Copy hicc.war into Apache Tomcat webapps directory.

  - Startup Tomcat.

RUNNING CHUKWA -- NETWORKED

Running Chukwa in a networked context is essentially similar to the single-machine
deployment discussed above.  However, in a network context, you would also need to
tell the local agent where the collector[s] live, by listing them in conf/collectors.
