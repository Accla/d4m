# Top-level makefile template for native hadoop code
#

#
# Notes: 
# 1. This makefile is designed to do the actual builds in $(HADOOP_HOME)/build/native/${os.name}-${os-arch}.
# 2. This makefile depends on the following environment variables to function correctly:
#    * HADOOP_NATIVE_SRCDIR 
#    * JAVA_HOME
#    * JVM_DATA_MODEL
#    * OS_NAME
#    * OS_ARCH 
#    All these are setup by build.xml. 
#

# Export $(PLATFORM) to prevent proliferation of sub-shells
export PLATFORM = $(shell echo $$OS_NAME | tr [A-Z] [a-z])

# List the sub-directories here
SUBDIRS = src/org/apache/hadoop/io/compress/zlib src/org/apache/hadoop/io/compress/lzo lib

# The following export is needed to build libhadoop.so in the 'lib' directory
export SUBDIRS

#
#vim: sw=4: ts=4: noet
