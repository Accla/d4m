  The Hadoop Documentation provides the information you need to get started using Hadoop, the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and Hadoop on Demand (HOD).
  </p><p>
Begin with the <a href="quickstart.html">Hadoop Quick Start</a> which shows you how to set up a single-node Hadoop installation. Then move on to the <a href="cluster_setup.html">Hadoop Cluster Setup</a> to learn how to set up a multi-node Hadoop installation. Once your Hadoop installation is in place, try out the <a href="mapred_tutorial.html">Hadoop Map/Reduce Tutorial</a>. 
  </p><p>
If you have more questions, you can ask on the <a href="ext:lists">Hadoop Core Mailing Lists</a> or browse the <a href="ext:archive">Mailing List Archives</a>.
