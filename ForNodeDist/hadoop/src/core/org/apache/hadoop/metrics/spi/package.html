The Service Provider Interface for the Metrics API.  This package provides
an interface allowing a variety of metrics reporting implementations to be
plugged in to the Metrics API.  Examples of such implementations can be found 
in the packages <code>org.apache.hadoop.metrics.file</code> and
<code>org.apache.hadoop.metrics.ganglia</code>.<p/>

Plugging in an implementation involves writing a concrete subclass of 
<code>AbstractMetricsContext</code>.  The subclass should get its
 configuration information using the <code>getAttribute(<i>attributeName</i>)</code>
 method.
