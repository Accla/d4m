<body>
Implementation of the metrics package that writes the metrics to a file.
Programmers should not normally need to use this package directly. Instead
they should use org.hadoop.metrics.

<p/>
These are the implementation specific factory attributes 
(See ContextFactory.getFactory()):

<dl>
    <dt><i>contextName</i>.fileName</dt>
    <dd>The path of the file to which metrics in context <i>contextName</i>
    are to be appended.  If this attribute is not specified, the metrics
    are written to standard output by default.</dd>
    
    <dt><i>contextName</i>.period</dt>
    <dd>The period in seconds on which the metric data is written to the
    file.</dd>
    
</dl>
