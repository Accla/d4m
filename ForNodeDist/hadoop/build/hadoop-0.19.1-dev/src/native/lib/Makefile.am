# Makefile template for building libhadoop.so 
#

#
# Notes: 
# 1. This makefile is designed to do the actual builds in $(HADOOP_HOME)/build/native/${os.name}-${os.arch}/lib 
# 2. This makefile depends on the following environment variables to function correctly:
#    * HADOOP_NATIVE_SRCDIR 
#    * JAVA_HOME
#    * OS_ARCH 
#    All these are setup by build.xml and/or the top-level makefile.
#

# Add .lo files in $(SUBDIRS) to construct libhadoop.so
