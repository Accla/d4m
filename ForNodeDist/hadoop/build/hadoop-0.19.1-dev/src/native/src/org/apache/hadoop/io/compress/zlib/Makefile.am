# Makefile template for building native 'zlib' for hadoop.
#

#
# Notes: 
# 1. This makefile is designed to do the actual builds in $(HADOOP_HOME)/build/native/${os.name}-${os.arch}/$(subdir) .
# 2. This makefile depends on the following environment variables to function correctly:
#    * HADOOP_NATIVE_SRCDIR 
#    * JAVA_HOME
#    * JVM_DATA_MODEL
#    * OS_ARCH 
#    * PLATFORM
#    All these are setup by build.xml and/or the top-level makefile.
# 3. The creation of requisite jni headers/stubs are also done by build.xml and they are
#    assumed to be in $(HADOOP_HOME)/build/native/src/org/apache/hadoop/io/compress/zlib.
#

# The 'vpath directive' to locate the actual source files 
vpath %.c $(HADOOP_NATIVE_SRCDIR)/$(subdir)
