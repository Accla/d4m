INSTALLATION INSTRUCTION FOR JAVA PACKAGE INTO OCTAVE


For Octave-3.2.2/4,  use java-2.2.7.tar.gz
For Octave-3.3.X (or later), use java-2.2.8.tar.gz

You can install the java package as root or user without administrative privileges.
If you install it as root, then all users would have access to
the package. However, you can install it in your home directory to
make it accessible to only you.


1. Define JAVA_HOME environment variable.
   Add JAVA_HOME/bin to the PATH environment variable.

   For example, 
     linux>  export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/jdk1.6.0_21
     linux>  export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH
  

2. Start octave in the directory where the java-X.X.X.tar.gz is located.

3. At the octave prompt, type

     octave>  pkg install  java.X.X.X.tar.gz

   This will install the java-X.X.X package.

4. To check that the package was installed or to list what packages are installed use
the  "pkg list" command

     octave>  pkg list

in JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/amd64/client. The symbolic link should point at
